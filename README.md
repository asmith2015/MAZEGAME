# MazeGame
1) Basic Project Outline that answers the following:
• What is your project?
My project is a series of mazes that increase difficultly by level. There are a total of three levels. 
• How can the user interact with your project?
The user can interact with the project by pressing the buttons on the Meggy Jr. to get through the maze.
• What is the ultimate goal?
The ultimate goal is to eat the aqua dots and get to the next level and eventually get to the smiley face, which indicates that you’re done.
• What are the obstacles that must be overcome to achieve the ultimate goal?
You must figure out the configuration of the invisible maze and also how to get to the aqua dot of the last level.
2) Responses to the following questions:
• Other than to complete an assignment, what did you want to accomplish by creating this project?
I wanted to create a game that makes you think about your actions, instead of just going through a motion.
• How well does this project accomplish what you set out to do?
The game challenges you to think about your next moves because you can’t find a clear path in the last maze.
• Discuss in detail a time when you got stuck, and how you got unstuck.
I got really stuck because of the order of the way my code was set up. It was a mess, but Ms. Kiang went through each section of the code to help me clean it up and get it working again.
• Tell of a time a classmate helped you and of a time you were able to help a classmate with this assignment.
Melissa went through my code once and helped me find a problem in my code that wasn’t allowing my dot to move. I helped Tati by giving her a piece of my collision code.
• If you could improve on your project in one way, what would that be?
If I could improve on my project in one way it would be to disable the collision for the second level.
3) Beta testing
• Whose project did you test?  What valuable feedback were you able to give them? 
I tested Melissa’s project when it was nearing the end of its final stages. I was able to give them advice on what they should do next. I suggested that when they touch the mountains that they would and that the gravity needed to be higher.
• Who beta tested your project? How did their feedback help you with your own project?
Hidemi, Melissa, and Ms. Saban beta tested my project. Ms. Saban told me about the wrapping, but I don’t know how to code for it.
4) Meggy Jr
• Consider your whole experience with Arduino and the Meggy Jr RGB.
~ What do you like about programming for the Meggy Jr?
I liked programming for the Meggy Jr. because there are a lot of colors and lights.
~ What was challenging about programming with the Meggy Jr?
I didn’t like how the Meggy code is set up and how something as little as a capital can affect your code.
~ What resources were the most useful for the questions you had about Meggy Jr and Arduino?
Students, the Meggy book, and Ms. Kiang were most useful for answering my questions about Ardunio and the Meggy.
~ What advice would you give to someone just starting to learn to code for an Arduino device?
Look at the code of other examples of Ardunio to help you understand what’s going on.
~ What are you most proud of regarding your programming abilities and projects, so far?
I am most proud of my ability to code moving things, but I always put them in the wrong order.
